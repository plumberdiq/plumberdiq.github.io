Your garbage disposal features a. hex wrench that can be used to place into the opening situated at the bottom of the unit. Try to insert a broom plunger or manage into the sink drain opening and attempt to turn the jammed flywheel if you can't find this wrench. If it appears to be moving freely turn the system back on (and don't forget to turn back on the circuit breaker if you don't it off) and see if the unit is working.</p>
