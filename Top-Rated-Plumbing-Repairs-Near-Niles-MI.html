<p>You'll need an unique waste disposal unit if you home uses a septic system and drain field. The unit should grind the waste even finer to avoid clogs and enable the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. As soon as, the gas pipe turns up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but must then shift to galvanized. I am uncertain why that should be.

<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
