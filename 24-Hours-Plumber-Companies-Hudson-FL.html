Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue.

Garbage disposal guarantees last an average of 5 years, however they can vary between 2 and ten years. Considering that the typical life-span of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you might wish to buy a prolonged guarantee. A lot of guarantees cover the cost to repair and replace typical wear and tear failures.
