I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed.
