<p>Hard water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water travels through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is usually utilized in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>

The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel generally constructed out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with negatively charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener depend on the control valve or softener head as it is commonly referred to. Most popular water softeners have an automatic regenerating system.  The most basic type has an electric timer that flushes and recharges the system on a routine schedule.</p>

<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
