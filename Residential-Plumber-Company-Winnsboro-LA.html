<p>A reduction in supply side pressure caused by an event such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire combating, causes the supply pressure to drop below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Examine Valve enables the excess client side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge till the supply side pressure again goes beyond the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
