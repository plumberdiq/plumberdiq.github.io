Getting a new one is more economical if the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a brand-new one. Plumbing and piping technology has improved over the last 30 years. Copper has actually been the preferred option to replace galvanized iron pipes (which used to be considered extremely strong, but they were found to split under pressure and tend to wear away within a few years). Today, the majority of quality contractors use PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>To decrease the need of gas line repair, it is essential to understand the typical reasons for gas leakages. Indoor gas leakages from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning devices happen most frequently in the winter season.

If you have not done so currently, we recommend setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to alert you of any possible gas leakages.</p>
