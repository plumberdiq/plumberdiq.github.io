<p>In this situation, unclean water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Dual flush valves are ending up being increasingly more typical, as both consumers and manufacturers seek new ways to conserve water. Dual flush toilets allow the user to pick the level of water required to flush the toilet based on whether the waste is liquid or strong. We've all heard the old expression, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down." Well, many people find that squicky - therefore the dual flush was born so you can still flush it down if it's yellow, you're simply using less water to do it.</p>

If you water with drinkable water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, safe and clean and watering, you are likewise needed to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
