<p>This kind of valve is used on agricultural areas. It is meant to keep the local water system clean in the existence of numerous farming pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals. The use of these items is called chemigation. There are a number of components to this valve. The check valve has a spring ran flapper, which enables circulation in just one direction.

This is where the chemicals are presented to go downstream of the check valve.</p>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that should also be well maintained to assist avoid leakages and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl.

Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape.</p>
