<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you ultimately check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high threat" establishments.</p>
