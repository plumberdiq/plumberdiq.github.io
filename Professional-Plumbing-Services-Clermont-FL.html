<p>, if you're tired of living with the side-effects of tough water, a water softening system from RainSoft can provide you with the service you need. Ever since we first opened in 1953, our water softeners have made a difference in the lives of many homeowners in North America and worldwide. Our premium system, the EC4 whole home water softener, is a modern product that uses a procedure of ion exchange to remove the minerals that trigger tough water. By replacing the bicarbonate, magnesium, and calcium ions that trigger water hardness with salt or potassium ions, the EC4 softens hard water by addressing its source. Furthermore, thanks to its special, integrated microprocessor, the EC4 system will learn your normal water use patterns, adjusting its soft water delivery based on your needs. In this way, our premium water softener ensures that you'll have an unrestricted supply of soft water whenever you need it.</p>
<p>Water lines must be completely flushed before setting up the assembly. Many test failures on brand-new installations are the outcome of particles fouling among the check valves or the relief valve.

But the intent of the code is to only connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers are present. Recent Review: A journeyman plumber and his assistant shown up throughout the appointed time period. They unplugged the sinks, cleaned up and recommended a tool to be used in the future.</p>
<p>Without a water softener, laundry needs extra cleaning agent to prevent it from looking dingy. Meals will come out of your dishwasher streaked and stained. Filmy scum develops on your shower curtains and your soap and shampoo will not lather. Bathing in tough water leaves your skin itchy and dry and your hair lifeless and sticky.
