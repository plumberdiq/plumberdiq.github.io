<p>The next action for an ambitious plumbing contractor is to earn a contractor's license. Licensed plumbing contractors can own their own plumbing organisation and hire or subcontract work to other licensed plumbers. State licensing requirements for plumbing contractors usually include paying an application cost and passing a thorough business, law and building regulations exam. Some neighborhood colleges and technical schools offer contractor's license preparation and renewal courses.
