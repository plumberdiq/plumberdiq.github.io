<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
