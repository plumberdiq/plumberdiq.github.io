If health or environmental reasons demand restricting salt, substituting potassium chloride for salt chloride may be suitable. With time, the beads become covered with minerals and have to be cleaned up. This cleaning process, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: backwash, recharge and rinse. The regeneration process can be scheduled instantly with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
<p>Do you need a replacement for an older system that's ended up being frustrating, or simply for a new look? How about for a building addition or significant remodel?
