<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be gotten rid of by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin has actually currently been fouled. Again, it is advisable to check the producer's directions for unique preventative measures.</p>

Softeners likewise will remove approximately 10 parts per million (ppm) of iron and manganese. Water materials with high levels of iron and manganese (higher than 10 ppm) may need pretreatment to prolong the life expectancy of a water softener.
