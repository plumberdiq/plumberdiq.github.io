<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
