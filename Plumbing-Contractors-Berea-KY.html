<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Because they can hinder the blades, cooking oil and other greases must never ever be put down the garbage disposal. Lastly, cold water needs to be running when the garbage disposal is on and should continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is switched off to ensure that all food particles have actually been washed through the pipes. Baffles: Baffles avoid silverware from going into the garbage disposal, so you're just sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
