<p>You'll need an unique waste disposal unit if you home utilizes a septic tank and drain field. The unit must grind the waste even finer to prevent clogs and allow the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. When, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, however should then transition to galvanized. I am not exactly sure why that need to be. It is likewise allowed to use black iron if it is probably covered with a galvanized finishing (which is generally an unique paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E frequently does this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you must constantly run cold water while the waste disposal unit is on to ensure that food bits are totally pressed through.
