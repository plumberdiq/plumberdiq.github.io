<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Contractor in Nottingham</h2>

<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it must put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank renewed.</p>
