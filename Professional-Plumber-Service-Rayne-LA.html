When it concerns the problem of hard water, a conventional water softener actually removes calcium, magnesium and silica ions, leaving it with small amounts of what is called momentary firmness". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
