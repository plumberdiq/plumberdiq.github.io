<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly.
