<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive.

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is just recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally salt or often potassium).</p>
