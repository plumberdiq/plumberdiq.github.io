<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>

Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash market.

Baffles: Baffles prevent silverware from going into the waste disposal unit, so you're only sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
