<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.

<p>Numerous toilet problems, including leaking toilets, do not demand repairing the entire toilet.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks beverages. Many, if not most, water pipes are made from copper.

The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
