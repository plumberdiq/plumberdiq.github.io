<p>Garbage disposals are created to operate in one of 2 ways. Either through what's called a batch feed, where the unit is filled, then covered before it is switched on, or through a constant feed, where the system can be filled while it is running. An approved backflow prevention device, which must be checked each year, must be installed on the service connection that the department has identified as having a potential for backflow. Keep in mind to check the background and research evaluations of your sewer cleaning company. If someone is utilizing fear of pricey sewer-overflow damage (which in many cases can be avoided by instantly stopping water use in your home) or pushing high-pressure sales techniques, take a step back and get a consultation.</p>
