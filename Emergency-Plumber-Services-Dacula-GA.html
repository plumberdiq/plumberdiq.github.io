<h3>Do's And Don'ts Of Emergency Plumbing Troubles Dacula GA</h3>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>

<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Dacula GA</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains considerable quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium.
