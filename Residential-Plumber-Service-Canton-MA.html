<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a reduction in supplied pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to escape.
