Each spring-loaded check valve is set to permit water at anticipated functional pressure to stream through. Need to backflow occur, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs slam the valves shut tight, avoiding the entryway of cross contamination water.</p>

It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly.
