<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it tough to gain access to in-wall pipes, think about at least changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big task, replacing exposed pipes in a basement, crawlspace, or energy  room is fairly uncomplicated, because the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets ought to definitely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be replaced. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>
