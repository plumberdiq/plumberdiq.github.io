<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Eastpointe MI</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system should be continuously kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many house centers bring only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
