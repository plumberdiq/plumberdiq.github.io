In this configuration the loop should be higher than 33 feet to operate appropriately. When designed this way it avoids siphoning and backflow into a water system.</p>
<p>If your hot water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. As a result, we suggest replacing your system if it is over ten years old. Under no circumstances must you ever attempt to fix gas leaks yourself. Contact a membe rof our gas pipe installer team to get support with a gas line installation, replacement, or repair task in the Chicago suburbs.

<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain won't fix the issue. You might need to look into utilizing a high pressure water system to get rid of the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
