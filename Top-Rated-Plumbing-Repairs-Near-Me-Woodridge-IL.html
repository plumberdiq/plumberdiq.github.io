Backflow is an issue because it can cause wastewater to flow back into a home, infecting the drinking water. Cover the flapper valve with your hand. Switch on the water (meticulously, so you don't get a cold shower!) and let it eliminate the toilet valve for a few seconds.</p>

Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water flows at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close.

Water purveyors likewise generally need backflow preventers to be checked regularly and maintained by certified professionals to ensure they are reliable and working correctly. It is essential to contact your local water authority to understand specific requirements for backflow preventers in your area.</p>
