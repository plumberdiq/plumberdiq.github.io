Water solidity is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Since soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum, the factor you can feel the distinction on your skin is. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. And that's where the term hardness" originated from ... it's tough to clean in.</p>
