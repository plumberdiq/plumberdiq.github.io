<p>A water softener has a resin tank including countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regenerated, the beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As tough water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. When water is warmed, difficult water triggers white or gray deposits. Water softening can be utilized to lower these signs.</p>
