<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Although water-producing companies do have the opportunity to produce softened water, they will not constantly do so. A water producing company only needs to add a water softener in its water purification system, to produce softened water inexpensively. Without a professional having examined your pipes, it can be challenging to know if repiping is the best response. At Harris Plumbing, Heating, Air & Propane, our South Jersey repiping experts can assist you to make a decision for your home.
