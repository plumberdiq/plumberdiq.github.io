<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. Because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is.

One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
