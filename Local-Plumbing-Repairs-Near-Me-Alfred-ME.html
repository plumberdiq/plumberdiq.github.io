In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane.

<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
