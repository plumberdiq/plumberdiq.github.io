<p>We concentrate on storm drain inspections and cleaning. Softened water is not recommended for watering house plants, gardens and lawns due to its sodium material. Water used in recharging a water softener might overload or reduce the effectiveness of small septic or sewer systems. Salt intake might position health threats.
