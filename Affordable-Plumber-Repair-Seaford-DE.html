<p>An rdc resembles a DC in that it is a mechanical backflow preventer including 2 independently acting, spring-loaded check valves. Nevertheless, it normally does not consist of shutoff valves, might or might not be geared up with test cocks or ports, and is generally less reliable than a DC. An rdc is effective versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but must be used to isolate just nonhealth threats and is planned for usage just in water service connections to single-family houses.</p>
