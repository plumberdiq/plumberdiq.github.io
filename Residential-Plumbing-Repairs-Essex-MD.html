<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The 2 dead giveaways of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up over time, they slowly begin to constrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much buildup to take place, so by the time you notice it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, impacting your water quality.</p>
