Consequently residential licenses provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be checked yearly. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring before operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be checked annually to guarantee the safety of the potable drinking water in your home.
