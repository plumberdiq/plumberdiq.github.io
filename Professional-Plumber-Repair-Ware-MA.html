Double Check Valve assemblies are the most common type used on irrigation systems in Horseshoe Bay. The minerals become caught and attached to the resin as the sodium is released into the water, thus removing them and softening the water. If you have an older home, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their lifespan.

Some do not allow the use of a PVB at all, so check with your water company. A PVB backflow preventer might spill or spit water out from under the cap when backflow happens, so it ought to be set up in a location where water spillage would not cause problems.</p>
