However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of house centers bring only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close.
