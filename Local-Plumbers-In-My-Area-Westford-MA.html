<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly saved for later usage when demand rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
