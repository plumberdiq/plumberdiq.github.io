It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Sadly, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger.

<p>It is necessary to keep your drainage system in excellent shape. It's what keeps your house clean, safe and without water build-up.
