<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Hingham MA</h3>
<p>Similar to kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your bathtub, sink, or shower) can be corrected quickly if the clog is shallow and easy. For most clogs you'll simply need a plunger, and sometimes some chemicals, but if this does not fix the problem then you might likewise have to employ a drain professional like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is also more difficult to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
<p>A. We highly advise a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers block any water from back or negative pressure in your watering system at shutdown from getting in back into your water source, hence lowering the risk of contamination of your water source. Many municipalities need the use of an approved backflow preventer in drip watering systems. You might want to check with your local municipality prior to installing your watering system.</p>
