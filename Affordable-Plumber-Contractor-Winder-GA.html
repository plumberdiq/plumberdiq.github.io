<p>Your initial step is to shut down the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home.

Let it sit for a few minutes, and after that flush with hot water to clear the mixture. Have steel or iron piping and notification rust-colored water originating from your water appliances? This is an excellent indicator that your pipes might be rusting from the within and for that reason, need to be replaced. Bear in mind that if the rust-colored water only features warm water, the cause could be a rusted out hot water heater-- not your home's piping.</p>
