<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you might need to make a time-wasting journey to the store. To prevent this, make certain the brand-new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or buy one independently at the very same time for about $3.</p>
<p>Hard water, debris from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can avoid a flush valve from closing completely. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the particles. Pictures 1 and 2 show you how to do this on one typical kind of valve. Despite the fact that other valves will look different, the clearing process is comparable. However, you may need to remove a few screws on top of the fill valve to get rid of the cap.</p>
