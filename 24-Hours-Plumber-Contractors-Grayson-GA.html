The correction must be made before water service is permitted if the present backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the occupant or the home owner.</p>

You might be wasting hundreds of gallons of water and hundreds of dollars on an inefficient toilet. If you wish to put new pipes in your house or you're developing a house, there are 3 types of brand-new plumbing pipe readily available that are building-code approved for homes-- copper, PEX, and CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride).

In basic, it's an economical service that will stand the test of time. We typically recommend this material, though it will depend.</p>
