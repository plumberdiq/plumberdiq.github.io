<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
