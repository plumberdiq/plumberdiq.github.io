<p>In this situation, dirty water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Dual flush valves are ending up being a growing number of typical, as both makers and customers look for brand-new ways to conserve water. Double flush toilets permit the user to choose the level of water needed to flush the toilet based on whether the waste is liquid or solid.

Many water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank renewed.</p>
