<p>In this method, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated. Fast heating gas heaters, as a basic guideline, will heat water far much faster than an electric water heater of the exact same basic measurements and capacity. An electric hot water heater may take a complete hour to heat 25 gallons, and a gas heater might heat up two times that quantity in the same offered time and perhaps much faster.</p>
<p>Regrettably, when water is entirely removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically becomes destructive.
