<p>The US Department of Energy states that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a home, beside heating and cooling. The quantity of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs. As you home ages the water traveling through your pipes collects more sediment. This is why repiping your home makes sense. Then lay a towel in the sink and set the disposal on the flange to keep it from moving.</p>
<p>Sometimes you understand you have a sewer line break because you can smell foul odors or you have a sewage back-up in your house. It is essential to identify the precise location of the break in your sewer line. Often times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and understanding this can save you thousands of dollars in repairs. Merely sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can solve the issue.

<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The 2 dead giveaways of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate over time, they gradually begin to restrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much accumulation to take place, so by the time you notice it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, impacting your water quality.</p>
