<p>Your sewer line problem can lead to sewer backups, and they typically happen in the lowest open drain. This type of problem is generally the outcome of an obstruction in the line. If you don't identify the odor coming from the sewer backup, you might recognize this issue because a backup takes place whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house is dependent upon the main sewer line for proper drainage. If, however, only one drain has backup problems, there's an isolated concern with only that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage issue.</p>
