We had an excellent experience with Joe Boyette, he was very professional, polite, qualified. We had a great deal of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month duration. We likewise needed to replace a water and a bathroom heater unrelated to the fire, but we felt great in Joe's capabilities. We made the decision to stay with Joe, although we felt Mr Rooter rates were definitely on the high-end. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>
