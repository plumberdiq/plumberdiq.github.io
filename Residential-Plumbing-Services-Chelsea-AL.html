Transporting takes place when the inbound difficult water follows a narrow course through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened. If you have actually ever discovered that the busier your company is, the much better your detergent works, the perpetrator could be a large softener.</p>
