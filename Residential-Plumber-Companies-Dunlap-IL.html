<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Lots of, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe.

Extra requirements: no piping including copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
