<p>To connect a power cable to the new unit, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires discovered inside with their equivalents in the cable, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. If you water with drinkable water, you are required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection.
