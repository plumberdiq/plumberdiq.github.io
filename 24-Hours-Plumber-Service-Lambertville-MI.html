A video inspection is usually required to discover the source of the recurring problem.</p>

Electric varieties are likewise simpler to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less most likely to lose heat.

<p>There are 2 very good reasons to insist on a sewer camera inspection of your sanitary and storm sewer prior to buying.

Sadly where there are trees there are generally tree roots and they like to discover water inside of your sewer. There is no chance of knowing whether you have a tree root infestation without seeing it with a camera inspection. You can chance and wait for the very first downpour but I believe you 'd rather not.</p>
