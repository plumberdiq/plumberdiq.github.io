<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>

Attempt releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
