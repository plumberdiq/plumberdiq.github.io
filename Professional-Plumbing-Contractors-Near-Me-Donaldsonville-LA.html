<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily kept for later usage when demand rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
