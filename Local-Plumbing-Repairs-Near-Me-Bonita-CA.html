<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily saved for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
