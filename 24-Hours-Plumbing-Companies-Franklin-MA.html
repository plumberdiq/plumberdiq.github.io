<p>Back-pressure is the reverse from regular flow instructions within a piping system as the outcome of the downstream pressure being higher than the supply pressure. This reduction in supply pressure occurs whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided (such as during water-line flushing, fire-fighting, or breaks in water mains). Garbage disposal guarantees last an average of 5 years, however they can range between 2 and ten years. Given that the average life expectancy of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you may want to purchase an extended warranty. The majority of guarantees cover the cost to repair and replace regular wear and tear failures. To avoid additional malfunctions, property owners should keep up with routine maintenance of their garbage disposal.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the concern if this is the case. You might have to look into using a high pressure water supply to eliminate the clog. This process is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
