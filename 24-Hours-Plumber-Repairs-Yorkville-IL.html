The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
