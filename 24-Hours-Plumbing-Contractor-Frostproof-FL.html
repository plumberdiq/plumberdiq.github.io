<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance might take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>
