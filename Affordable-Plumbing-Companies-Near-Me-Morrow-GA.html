<p>The program achieves its objective by attending to the adoption and promulgation of ideal guidelines and policies for the construction of plumbing centers where mandated.

<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it must put something back into the water. A lot of water softeners use an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank replenished.</p>
