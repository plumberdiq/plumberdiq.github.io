In a separate drain path, small pipes run from the tub and sink to ultimately meet a bigger one underneath the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and eventually out of the house. A great method to decrease the quantity of food waste in your kitchen is to install a waste disposal unit. Rapidly and effectively eliminating leftover potato peels, fruit skins and lots of other kinds of food waste, the disposal grinds it all into fine particles that are flushed out of the chamber and into your house drainage, waste and vent system or what you most likely call your sewer.</p>
