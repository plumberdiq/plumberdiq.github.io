For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it intends straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can in fact trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, inspect for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
