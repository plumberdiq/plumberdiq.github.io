Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and require fewer repairs in time.

<p>Trees and shrubs are a typical reason for sewer blockages to the home. Roots can grow into the smallest crack or gap in your home's drain pipe, where they thrive in the nutrient rich environment supplied by the sewer. Flat roofing systems typically have drains spaced out around their border. The drains are linked to vertical pipes that are generally connected to underground horizontal pipes connected to local storm sewage systems. Roto-Rooter can mechanically clean these drains from one end to the other to restore flow and prevent water collection on top of the building's roof.</p>
<p>To decrease the need of gas line repair, it's important to understand the typical causes of gas leaks. Indoor gas leakages from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning devices happen most frequently in the winter season. This is due to the fact that houses are not adequately ventilated throughout the cooler months to avoid heat loss. We advise setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to inform you of any possible gas leaks if you haven't done so currently.</p>
