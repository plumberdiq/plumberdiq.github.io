Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water firmness can be eliminated relatively easily by using an ion exchange treatment. Basic water softeners are cation exchange gadgets. Cations describe favorably charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange involves the replacement of the solidity ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>Basic water softeners discovered in house supply and hardware stores will remove almost all the calcium and magnesium from the raw water during the softening process. Softeners likewise will remove up to 10 parts per million (ppm) of iron and manganese. Water materials with high levels of iron and manganese (higher than 10 ppm) might need pretreatment to prolong the life expectancy of a water softener.
