<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
